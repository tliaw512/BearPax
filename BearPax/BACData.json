        "Description": "AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme commonly found in low levels in the blood. When the liver is damaged, additional AST is released into the bloodstream and is directly related to the extent of tissue damage. Detecting AST can help identify specific liver disease, check the effect of medication and determine success of treatment for the liver."
